⚠️ WHAT THIS TOOL CAN NOT DO ⚠️
It can not track special bets. Hence if you're mainly betting prop markets & exotic derivatives then this tool is not for you.

❓ WHY WOULD I WANT YET ANOTHER BET TRACKER ❓
Because it calculates your clv/edge accurately. Probably THE most important thing you want to know.

A basic requirement to profitable betting is to log your bets. At a bare minimum you want to log EVERY BET and know your overall P/L + ROI for each strategy/model you follow.

You can then apply all sorts of metrics to your sample (such as ROI, P-VALUE). Many of them won't be very helpful in making any meaningful conclusions!

Most of the commonly used metrics will suffer from small sample sizes and/or Survivorship Bias as discussed in this article here https://tinyurl.com/illusionofskill 

Worst case is that you end up with a false positive, i.e. the illusion that you have an edge when in fact you have none.

WHAT YOU WANT IS A CLEAR SIGNAL. A metric that tells you if and what edge you have over any particular market.

Enter CLV. Closing Line Value.

❓ WHAT IS CLV AND WHY IS IT SO IMPORTANT TO UNDERSTAND ❓

In a nutshell clv compares the price you take against the (true) closing price. The true closing price is the price just before kickoff with the bookmaker margin removed. Since the true closing price reflects the true probability of an outcome quite accuratey, you will know instantly if you have made a value bet or not.

For the math-savvy, here is the formula.

clv = o / t - 1

where

o...are the obtained odds, i.e. the price you took at your book
t...the true closing price, a.k.a. the no-vig closing price

This means IF THE OBTAINED PRICE IS HIGHER THAN THE NO-VIG CLOSING PRICE YOU MADE A VALUE BET!

IN OTHER WORDS: NO CLV = NO EDGE!

Understanding closing line value (= clv) is absolutely vital for aspiring sports bettors.

As soon as you get a grasp on this metric you will think completely differently (and properly!) about your bet.

All of a sudden the outcome becomes irrelevant!

If you take a bet at 3.5 and it closes at 2.8. Happy Days.

Regardless of whether the bet wins or not.

That's how professional bettors think!

Another thing of beauty is that you do not need a very large sample if analysing for clv. Usually 50 - 100 bets will suffice to get a good idea where you are heading. Hence if your clv is +2.50% over 100 bets then you can be pretty confident that this is approximately your expected roi.
